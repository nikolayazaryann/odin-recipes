    <h3>Ingredients :</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 kg of minced meat (mixing pork and beef only will do too)</li>
        <li>1 kg of potatoes, peeled and finely choped in cubes</li>
        <li>2 tomatoes, finely choped</li>
        <li>1 onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>parsley, 1/3 cupful, finely chopped</li>
        <li>3 eggs, beaten</li>
        <li>1 cup yoghurt</li>
        <li>2 tablespoon flour</li>
        <li>salt and pepper for taste</li>
        <li>oil for cooking</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons of chubritza (a Bulgarian herb which you could substitute with some Herbes de Provance or Oregano), ofcourse the taste will be different</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>How to make it:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Fry the onion and the minced meat in a little oil.</li> 
            <li>The more fatty the meat is, the less oil you need.</li> 
            <li>In about 10 minutes take it off the hob and mix well with the potatoes, tomatoes, and parsley. Add salt and pepper to taste. Bake about 45 minutes at 190C degrees, or until the potatoes
            are cooked.</li>
            <li>Stir the eggs, the yoghurt and the flour together and pour it over the dish.</li>
            <li> Bake it for 10 more minutes. It's delicious with cold yoghurt on the side. Enjoy! </li>
